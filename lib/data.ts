    longDescription: `Fundit is one of my proudest creations — a crowdfunding platform tailored for student innovators with bold startup ideas but limited capital. This platform bridges the gap between those visionaries and impact-focused investors.
<h2>My Role:</h2>
I was deeply involved in the backend layer of this project — from planning the user flow and designing database relationships to implementing real-time messaging and secure fund handling using escrow logic. It was both a technical challenge and a rewarding journey.

<h2>Key Features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Student entrepreneurs can create projects, set funding goals, and manage milestones.</li>
<li>Investors can browse projects, contribute funds, and track progress.</li>
<li>Admin dashboard for overseeing project statuses and user management.</li>
<li>Escrow-based fund flow to ensure secure transactions and milestone approvals.</li>
<li>Real-time chat system for seamless communication between students and investors.</li>
<li>Full-stack architecture using React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical Highlights:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation.</li>
<li>Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern UI design.</li>
<li>Prisma ORM for efficient database interactions.</li>
<li>Socket.io for real-time communication features.</li>
<li>REST API for robust data handling and user authentication with NEXT Auth.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Project Management:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Implemented a 3-user role architecture: Student, Investor, Admin.</li>
<li>Admin assignment logic to maintain focused project ownership.</li>
<li>Project lifecycle management from pending → active → funded → completed.</li>
<li>Escrow-based fund flow with milestone tracking and approval.</li>
<li>Real-time chat system with Socket.io.</li>
<li>Full-stack architecture (React + Node.js + PostgreSQL).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why it Matters:</h2>
We wanted to create more than a platform — we wanted to give student entrepreneurs the tools and support to launch real ventures, while offering investors a meaningful way to contribute and grow their capital.`,
